  The Maven Artifact Plugin...

* Recording <<<.buildinfo>>> File

  Recording build result into a <<<.buildinfo>>> file is typically done on command line by calling <<<artifact:buildinfo>>> goal after the normal build:

-------
$ mvn clean verify artifact:buildinfo
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] 
[INFO] ----------------< org.apache.maven.sample:test-project >----------------
[INFO] Building Test Project 1.0-SNAPSHOT
[INFO] --------------------------------[ jar ]---------------------------------
...
[INFO] --- maven-artifact-plugin:${project.version}:buildinfo (default-cli) @ test-project ---
[INFO] Saved info on build to /tmp/test-project/target/test-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.buildinfo
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------

  This records data on the current build results into a <<<.buildinfo>>> file using {{{https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/}Reproducible Builds <<<.buildinfo>>> for the JVM}} format.

  Notice that if the build is multi-module, only 1 <<<.buildinfo>>> file is generated, in the last module of the reactor, that will record aggregated results for all the modules.

* Checking Reproducible Build: Comparing Current Build Against Previous One

  When the <<<artifact:buildinfo>>> goal is used with <<<reference.repo>>> command-line parameter, it uses the parameter value as a reference of a remote repository
  (either its id like <<<central>>> or an url like <<<https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/maven-1619>>>)
  to get reference artifacts from it, then compares reference artifacts against current build output to display <<Reproducible Build output summary>>:

-------
$ mvn -Papache-release clean verify -Dgpg.skip artifact:buildinfo -Dreference.repo=central
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
